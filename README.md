# progressive-budget

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

We will be using mongoDB, mongoose, morgan and compression for the Server. 
I am also express.js for the api call for getting transactions.
